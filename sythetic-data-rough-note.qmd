# Introduction

## The Challenge of Healthcare Data

* Real patient data is sensitive and highly restricted.
* This makes sharing and collaboration difficult.
* The NHP model is open source, but the data is a blocker.

---

## Why Synthetic Data?

* **Privacy:** Protects patient confidentiality.
* **Accessibility:** Enables broader research and testing.
* **Reproducibility:** Allows anyone to run and verify the model.
* **Bias Mitigation:** Opportunity to create fairer datasets.

# Current NHS Artificial Data Limitations

## Problem: Lost Relationships

* The existing NHS artificial data excels at privacy.
* However, it struggles to preserve complex relationships between attributes.
* **Example:** It might tell you "how many 49-year-olds" and "how many females," but not "how many 49-year-old females with diabetes in a specific postcode."

## Impact on NHP Model

* NHP model relies on multivariate relationships for accurate demand prediction.
* Without these, models trained on current artificial data would be inaccurate.
* Obstacle to identifying which patients are candidates for a mitigator.

##The Consequence 

* The **inability to simulate real-world** interventions makes the output for demand prediction **unreliable** and **invalid**.
